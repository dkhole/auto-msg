Hey! I was looking at $ and yours is one of my favourites!
I normally buy off Gumtree but it's been a hassle having to organise delivery myself. Is your listing on Hookitnow? If not, put it up there! It's a second hand furniture marketplace with delivery integrated for the buyer and seller. Sign-up is free and it's based here in Sydney as well :)
Check it out! Posting on Hookitnow will definitely help you sell faster.
